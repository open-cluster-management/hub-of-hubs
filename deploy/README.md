### Deploying Hub-of-hubs

```
KUBECONFIG=$TOP_HUB_CONFIG ./deploy_hub_of_hubs.sh
```

### Using Hub-of-Hubs UI

The Hub-of-Hubs UI displayes managed clusters according to [Hub-of-Hubs RBAC](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/hub-of-hubs-rbac). By default,
the `kube-admin` user is given `admin` role in Hub-of-Hubs RBAC. If you want to give other OpenShift users access to managed clusters, you need to
[configure RBAC role bindings for your users](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/hub-of-hubs-rbac/blob/main/README.md#update-role-bindings-or-role-definitions).

### Undeploying Hub-of-hubs
