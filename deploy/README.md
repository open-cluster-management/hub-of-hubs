# Hub of Hubs

### Deploying Hub-of-hubs components

```
KUBECONFIG=$TOP_HUB_CONFIG ./deploy_hub_of_hubs.sh
```

### Using Hub-of-Hubs Web Console

The Hub-of-Hubs Web console displayes managed clusters according to [Hub-of-Hubs RBAC](https://github.com/stolostron/hub-of-hubs-rbac). By default,
the `kube-admin` user is given `admin` role in Hub-of-Hubs RBAC. If you want to give other OpenShift users access to managed clusters, you need to
[configure RBAC role bindings for your users](https://github.com/stolostron/hub-of-hubs-rbac/blob/main/README.md#update-role-bindings-or-role-definitions).

### Undeploying Hub-of-hubs components

```
KUBECONFIG=$TOP_HUB_CONFIG ./undeploy_hub_of_hubs.sh
```

----

# Hubs to connect to Hub of Hubs

This step is an optional step. the Hub-of-Hubs agent can be deployed automatically if the Hubs are the managed clusters of the Hub of Hubs.

## Deploying a Hub-of-Hubs agent

```
KUBECONFIG=$HUB1_CONFIG LH_ID=hub1 ./deploy_hub_of_hubs_agent.sh
```

## Undeploying a Hub-of-Hubs agent

```
KUBECONFIG=$HUB1_CONFIG LH_ID=hub1 ./undeploy_hub_of_hubs_agent.sh
```

----

## Linting

**Prerequisite**: install the `shellcheck` tool (a Linter for shell):

```
brew install shellcheck
```

Run
```
shellcheck *.sh
```
